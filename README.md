This repository is focused on **learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** with an emphasis on **concept building rather than programming languages**.

## 🔑 Key Idea
> **Languages change, concepts don’t.**

## 📌 What’s Inside
- Solved DSA problems
- Clear explanations for each solution
- Implementations in different languages
- Strong focus on logic & problem-solving

## 🛠 Languages
Solutions may use C++, Java, Python, etc.  
**Language is secondary — concepts are primary.**

## 🎯 Goal
To build strong DSA fundamentals and improve thinking for coding interviews and real problem solving.

## ⭐ Support
